# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION-USING-SEVERAL-CLASSIFICATION-MODELS

## ***Problem Statement:***
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using different classificaton model to identify the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on a set of clinical and demographic features. 
The dataset provided contains various patient attributes, including age, sex, Cigs Per Day, cholesterol level, blood pressure , glucose level, and other relevant factors.

The primary objective is to build a robust model that can accurately predict whether patients have 10 year risk of coronary heart disease CHD or not. The model's performance will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
Additionally, the project aims to identify the most significant features contributing to heart disease prediction, which can provide valuable insights for medical professionals in diagnosing and treating heart-related conditions.

By leveraging this predictive model, healthcare providers can make more informed decisions, potentially improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of heart disease on individuals and healthcare systems.


## ***DataSet:***
There are 16 features in the dataset that are represented in the form of columns, out of which I may choose to use the most important features during the implementation. I may use different feature reduction techniques, such as correlation analysis, feature importance from models, or principal component analysis (PCA), to select the most relevant features for predicting heart disease.

The dataset includes attributes such as 'male', 'age', 'education', 'cigsPerDay', 'BPMeds',
'prevalent Stroke', 'diabetes', 'totChol', 'sysBP', 'diaBP', 'BMI', 'heartRate', 'glucose', 'Ten YearCHD'. These features are critical for building a model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease.

## ***Implementation Strategy and algorithms Used:***
***I have decided to implement and compare 7 different models***<br>
1. Random Forest<br>
2. Logistic Regression <br>
3. K-means <br>
4. Decision Tree <br>
5. Naive Bayes <br>
6. Support vector machine <br>
7. Extreme Gradient Boost

## ***Model metrics and Evaluation:***
Evaluation of different models used in project uses confusion matrix for understanding the features patterns with Correlation Matrix and EDA and ROC plot for accuracy comparison and k-fold cross validation for minimizing overfitting.
